Afterwards, we stop at a working sheep farm on our Wicklow Mountain tour. Having taken in the sights of one of the most beautiful parts of the island, sit back, relax as we begin our return journey to Dublin.</p>\n<h3 class=\"headline text-align_auto typography-1\">KILKENNY CITY</h3>\n<p>With human activity and settlements in the area dating back to the Mesolithic Period, Kilkenny is a city which is as&nbsp;<strong>historic as it is charming</strong>. There are plenty of tales to be told around every corner; from kings and sieges to witch trials and murder. As part of your one day tour, you will&nbsp;<strong>arrive in Kilkenny at 10:00am</strong>&nbsp;for a&nbsp;<strong>walking tour</strong>&nbsp;of Ireland&rsquo;s medieval capital. But first, we have a quick break to stop for a coffee and recharge the batteries after the bus ride. Your 45 minute guided walking tour of Kilkenny City will take you through the narrow and winding cobbled streets and under the city&rsquo;s many&nbsp;<strong>medieval arches</strong>&nbsp;as you explore all the main attractions and landmarks. Along the way, your tour guide will&nbsp;<strong>entertain and inform&nbsp;</strong>you with the history of the city.</p>\n<p>After the walking tour, you will have a further 1 hour 45 minutes to&nbsp;<strong>explore Kilkenny at your own leisure.</strong>&nbsp;The city&rsquo;s compact nature means that all the points of interest are easily accessible by foot and you will have plenty of time to visit an attraction if you wish (admission is not included). You may choose to visit the&nbsp;<strong>famous 12th century Kilkenny Castle</strong>. The castle is the signature symbol of the city and is majestically located on the banks of the River Nore. Kilkenny Castle has a storied past and was once the Irish stronghold of the legendary Strongbow. Alternately, you could visit<strong>&nbsp;Rothe House</strong>, a magnificent example of a wealthy silk merchant&rsquo;s home built in 159. The house contains multiple medieval exhibits; including priceless Viking artefacts and a medieval garden which contains plants of the era including Gortahork cabbage and Blood of the Boyne apples.</p>\n<p>Kilkenny has a&nbsp;<strong>proud food heritage</strong>&nbsp;and you will have the opportunity to enjoy lunch while in the city. There is plenty to choose from including artisan caf&eacute;s and charming gastropubs. You tour guide will be happy to make lunch recommendations once you arrive in the city.&nbsp;<strong>Depart Kilkenny at 12:30pm.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"headline text-align_auto typography-1\">WICKLOW MOUNTAIN TOUR</h3>\n<p>After lunch, we travel through the county of Carlow into the&nbsp;<strong>wild and rugged Wicklow Mountains</strong>, specifically the Wicklow Gap and its scenery, which is the most varied on the island of Ireland. The landscape on your Wicklow Mountains tour will change from&nbsp;<strong>lush green rich pasture</strong>&nbsp;with gentle valleys, to the dramatic and the&nbsp;<strong>breathtaking ancient glacial valleys&nbsp;</strong>of the Wicklow Gap. The journey through the mountains will bring you through spectacular locations where famous movies such as Braveheart and PS I Love You were filmed.</p>\n<p>Enjoy a 20 minute stop for a stroll and&nbsp;<strong>photographic opportunities</strong>&nbsp;on top of the Wicklow Mountains overlooking the glens and valleys of County Wicklow.</p>\n<div class=\"typography-1\">\n<h3 class=\"headline text-align_auto typography-1\">GLENDALOUGH</h3>\n</div>\n<p>Continuing over the mountains as part of your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wildrovertours.com/why-visit-mythical-glendalough/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glendalough</a>&nbsp;day tour, we arrive at the<strong>world famous heritage site of Glendalough</strong>&nbsp;(Glen of two lakes)&nbsp;<strong>at 14:30pm</strong>. The landscape here is dominated by oak, Scots Pine and mixed woodland, and of course, the two lakes from which the name Glendalough is derived. The lower lake takes under an hour to walk and the upper just over an hour.</p>\n<p>On arrival in Glendalough, you can join your tour guide on a&nbsp;<strong>30-minute guided tour</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wildrovertours.com/blog/explore-the-monastic-city-of-glendalough/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glendalough&rsquo;s Monastic City</a>, an ancient window into the golden era of Irish history &ndash; the Early Christian period. The Monastic city is heralded as a<strong>&nbsp;national monument of immense importance</strong>&nbsp;and it is here that Irish monks &lsquo;saved civilisation&rsquo; while the rest of Europe went through the Dark Ages. The monastic site dates back to 600 AD and played an important role in reintroducing Christianity to Northern and Central Europe after the Dark Ages. It was here that the famous Irish monk Saint Kevin founded his monastery and round tower. This location later acted as a shelter for Christian manuscripts to protect them from the barbarous marauding Vikings.<br />Our guides will leave you with some of the&nbsp;<strong>folklore and legendary stories</strong>&nbsp;of Glendalough&rsquo;s past and direct you towards the stunning Upper Lake. You will have ample time take in the walk and fully appreciate the&nbsp;<strong>beauty of the area&rsquo;s natural wonders.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"headline text-align_auto typography-1\">ANNAMOE: SHEEP FARM AND DOG TRIALS</h3>\n<p>Our visitors have the opportunity to visit the&nbsp;<strong>village of Annamoe</strong>&nbsp;located at the foot of the Wicklow Mountains, where you get the unique chance to experience a&nbsp;<strong>Shepherd at work</strong>with his best friend the Border Collie Sheep Dog.</p>\n<p>The dog, listening to the whistling sounds from the Shepherd, will herd the sheep across fields, through gates and fencing into corrals, out again over ditches around trees to your feet. If you want an idea of what to expect, here is a short clip of the Irish sheep dog trials where shepherds and their dogs complete for sport: Depending on the time of the year you will also have the opportunity to hold and feed a little lamb. This is&nbsp;<strong>an experience not to be missed!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Departing Annamoe at 17:10</strong>, we journey through the highest village in Ireland known as Roundwood. From there you can see the&nbsp;<strong>Sugarloaf Mountains</strong>, which prior to the Ice Age were higher than the Alps. You can also catch a glimpse of the&nbsp;<strong>Powerscourt Estate and the Glen of Imaal</strong>&nbsp;just before reaching Kilmacanogue. Now it&rsquo;s time to sit back and relax as we begin our return journey and arrive&nbsp;<strong>back in Dublin city at approximately 6:15pm.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>During the months of November, December, January, February Subject to weather conditions on occasions the times of visiting the city of Kilkenny and<br />the monastic site of Glendalough will be reversed.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1htV-ruyFog2z-UpGOwhx00IdYtQ&amp;hl=en\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe></p>", "highlights": "<div class=\"icons-list--item\">\n<h4 class=\"headline text-align_auto typography-1\">WHY CHOOSE THIS TOUR:</h4>\n<p class=\"icons-list--item__text\">Listen to ancient tales of Kings and witches in historic Kilkenny</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"icons-list--item\">\n<div class=\"icons-list--item__icon\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p class=\"icons-list--item__text\">Travel the stunning landscape of the Wicklow Gap</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"icons-list--item\">\n<div class=\"icons-list--item__icon\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p class=\"icons-list--item__text\">Visit the filming location of films such as Braveheart &amp; PS.

Unique with day tour companies in Dublin, you have a dedicated tour guide who will tell you of the many stories and historical events which have occurred in this area of Meath over the centuries. For example, you will learn about the Battle of Boyne between King James (Catholic) and King William of Orange (Protestant &ndash; Dutch), a chapter in history which was&nbsp;<strong>hugely significant in the political, cultural and religious destinies of both Ireland and Britain.</strong>&nbsp;Crossing the border into the north of Ireland, there is no evidence which shows that you are entering another political state, but your guide will have some fascinating observations for you to see.

On your Northern Ireland day trip, you will visit and sign the Peace Line and join the list of world celebrities including Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama who have signed their name to the wall. Walk along this huge wall which divides the two religious/national communities of east Belfast. The political murals, some of which are the most spectacular in the world, reflect a harrowing and tragic chapter in the history of Northern Ireland. The Troubles, a conflict between the two communities of Northern Ireland, cost the lives of thousands of people as the paramilitary element of the minority nationalist community fought with the British State and the paramilitary element of the Protestant Loyalist community. These two paramilitary groups are depicted in many of the murals reflecting the different communities&rsquo; allegiances. Your personal local guide will relate to you their&nbsp;<strong>personal and family experiences&nbsp;</strong>of life in Belfast. Some of the stories you quite simply won&rsquo;t believe.<br />If you&rsquo;d rather not take a black taxi tour, you can alternately choose to visit the Belfast Titanic quarter and the&nbsp;<strong>state of the art Titanic Visitor Experience.</strong><br />Here you can experience the entire life and story of the Titanic, from her fateful maiden voyage to her eventful discovery on the seabed of the North Atlantic. Learn about the origins, construction, launch and history of the Titanic.
